# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the SuprSelf app uses:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- The app uses many flutter dependencies and external packages.
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
